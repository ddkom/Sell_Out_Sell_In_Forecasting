## Why?
_**Business Problem**: The demand planning team for a global food manufacturing company requires reliable forecasts for sales orders in order ensure order fulfillment and meet sales quotas. Reliable forecasts should support their goal in reducing over and under production. With over production comes a risk of food waste and with under production, food shortage. As a data scientist & consultant, you are provided with approximately 40 months (or 4 years) of data for 40 products that each need to be forecasted at monthly lags 1 and 2.​_
